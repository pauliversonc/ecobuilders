# ECO Builders Website

This is a demo website for ECO Builders, showcasing my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Web design, and Responsive design.

## Technologies Used

The website was built using the following technologies:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## Features

The ECO Builders website includes the following features:

- Home page with an introduction to ECO Builders and a call-to-action button.
- About page with information about the company's history, values, and team members.
- Projects page with a gallery of the company's previous projects.
- Services page with descriptions of the company's services and a contact form.
- Testimonials page with quotes from satisfied customers.
- Contact page with a contact form and the company's contact information.
- Responsive design, making the website easily accessible on desktop and mobile devices.

## Design Approach

The ECO Builders website was designed using the **desktop first** approach, which means that the desktop version of the site was designed first and then scaled down for smaller screen sizes. This approach allowed for a more consistent and cohesive design across all screen sizes.
